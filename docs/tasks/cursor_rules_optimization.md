# Cursor Rules Optimization Plan

## Objective

Optimize the cursor rules documentation by creating separate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and streamlining the main cursor rules file.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Standard Operating Procedures

- [ ] Create SOP for Tool Creation with Agency Swarm CLI

  - Tool development guidelines
  - CLI command usage
  - Template structures
  - Testing procedures
  - Documentation requirements

- [ ] Create SOP for Tool Selection and Usage

  - Decision flowcharts for tool selection
  - Common task patterns
  - Tool combination strategies
  - Error handling procedures
  - Best practices for specific scenarios

- [ ] Create SOP for Agent Creation

  - Agent initialization process
  - Role definition
  - Communication setup
  - Integration with existing agents
  - Testing and validation

- [ ] Create SOP for Extended Context Management
  - Context preservation strategies
  - Token limit management
  - Information chunking techniques
  - State management across interactions
  - Recovery procedures

### 2. Modify Cursor Rules

- [ ] Update cursor rules to reference SOPs
- [ ] Remove redundant information
- [ ] Add clear navigation to relevant SOPs
- [ ] Maintain core principles and guidelines
- [ ] Update tool usage section to be more concise

### 3. Documentation Structure

#### SOP File Organization

```
docs/
├── sops/
│   ├── tool_creation.md
│   ├── tool_selection.md
│   ├── agent_creation.md
│   └── context_management.md
└── cursor_rules.md
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the `docs/sops` directory structure
2. Begin with the Tool Creation SOP
3. Iteratively create remaining SOPs
4. Update cursor rules with references
5. Test and validate documentation flow

## Success Criteria

- Clear, concise cursor rules document
- Comprehensive, well-organized SOPs
- Improved navigation between documents
- Reduced redundancy
- Better maintainability

## Notes

- Maintain consistent formatting across all documents
- Include practical examples in SOPs
- Add cross-references between related procedures
- Consider adding flowcharts for complex procedures
- Include troubleshooting sections in each SOP
