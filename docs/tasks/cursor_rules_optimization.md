# Cursor Rules Optimization Plan

## Objective

Optimize the cursor rules documentation by creating separate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and streamlining the main cursor rules file.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Standard Operating Procedures

- ✅ Create SOP for Tool Creation with Agency Swarm CLI
- ✅ Create SOP for Tool Selection and Usage
- ✅ Create SOP for Agent Creation
- ✅ Create SOP for Extended Context Management

### 2. Cursor Rules Updates

- ✅ Update cursor rules to reference SOPs
- ✅ Remove redundant information
- ✅ Add clear navigation to relevant SOPs
- ✅ Maintain core principles and guidelines
- ✅ Update tool usage section to be more concise
- ✅ Add autonomous operation patterns
- ✅ Add proactive information gathering
- ✅ Add decision frameworks
- ✅ Add adaptive patterns
- ✅ Add detailed examples and visualizations

## Current Tasks
